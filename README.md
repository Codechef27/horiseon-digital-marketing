## HTML Refactores

## Title
I Changed the title to Horiseon Digital Marketing. 

## Header 
I Changed the div element to a header element, deleted the span element & the .seo class, also, I restructured the h1 element.

## hero
I changed the div element to a section element. Also, I added the alt attribute to the image.

## Main 
I changed the div element to a main element, I added the alt attribute to the images, I added the id for s.e.o. and changed the p element to simple line /br element.

## Benifits
I added a blank text alt attribute to the images, to be safely ignored, I changed the div element to the article & section elements. 

## Footer
I changed the div element to a footer element, also, I used a line /br element instead of a p element.

## CSS Refactores 

## .header 
I removed .header h1 .seo class and moved the color #d9dcd6 to .header class.
I moved the li class styles to the .header div ul li class.
I removed the p class font-size 16px. (I was thinking website text is automatically displayed at 16px).

## .content
I consolidated the styles for the repeating class styles- img, h2 and content. 

## .benefits
I consolidated the styles for the repeating class styles- benefit-section, h3, and img.
